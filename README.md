### Color Scheme
Color scheme is important as this is one of the first things site visitors notice when visiting the site. I chose white / black for the site's primary colors because these colors match the secondary earthy colors and make the website look professional and high-end. In addition to that, for the secondary colors of the site, I wanted to create a natural / delicate atmosphere to represent the calming sensation of flowers. For the secondary colors, I used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to create a color pallet, which you can find below.
